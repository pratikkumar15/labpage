        We  build chemigenetic tools to image and manipulate biology by combining dye chemistry or click chemistry with genetic labeling strategies. We collaborate widely to generate tools for solving different biological problems.
        <p></p><p></p>We are currently hiring at all levels. Work in our lab integrates chemistry (organic synthesis, optical chemistry), spectroscopy, biomolecular labeling, and imaging. We put a strong emphasis on honing career-development skills.
