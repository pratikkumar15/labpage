I am a Principal Investigator at the National Center for Biological Sciences–Tata Institute of Fundamenal Research (NCBS–TIFR). I am a tool builder and my research interests broadly revolves around using the power of chemistry to solve problems in biology.

Prior to joining NCBS, I was a postdoc with <a href="https://www.janelia.org/lab/lavis-lab" target="_blank">Luke Lavis</a> at HHMI–Janelia Research Campus where I used fluorescent dyes to make reagents for cell biology, neuroscience, pharmacology, and imaging. During my PhD with <a href="https://www.laughlinlab.com" target="_blank">Scott Laughlin</a>, I made light and enzyme-controlled cyclopropenes for bioorthogonal labeling/imaging in cellular systems. Before moving to the US I worked on bactericidal, cationic gemini surfactants with <a href="https://www.jncasr.ac.in/jayanta" target="_blank">Jayanta Haldar</a>.

I strongly care about effective mentoring, diversity in academia, awareness about “alternative” career options, and communicating my science to the public.
