abstract: The application discloses a compound having a moiety that is either an affinity tag-containing moiety or a protein-manipulation moiety, a self-labeling protein (SLP) ligand, and a rhodamine dye linking the affinity tag-containing moiety or a protein-manipulation moiety to the SLP ligand. Also disclosed is a complex, which includes the compound and a SLP. Also disclosed is a method that involves contacting the compound and a SLP with a cell, and visualizing fluorescence in the cell or purifying the SLP and associated biological components from the cell.
